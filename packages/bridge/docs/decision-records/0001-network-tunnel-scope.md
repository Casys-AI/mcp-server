# ADR 0001: Network tunnel primitives belong in mcp-bridge

Date: 2026-05-09  Status: Accepted

## Context

Until now, `@casys/mcp-bridge` has been positioned as a **UI bridge** —
it serves MCP Apps `ui://` resources inside hosts that don't render
them natively (Telegram Mini Apps, LINE LIFF). The README, the package
description, and the directory layout (`adapters/telegram/`,
`adapters/line/`) reinforce this scope.

Independently, `@casys/mcp-compose/src/deploy/` ships a **design
document** (readme + contract + types, no impl) for publishing dashboards
on Deno Deploy, which includes a **WebSocket tunnel** for local-data
MCPs:

> *"Local-data MCPs (DB, Docker, local files) → SDK starts MCP locally
> → SDK opens outbound WebSocket to relay → Relay routes tool calls
> through tunnel."*

A new, unrelated project (`erp-platform`, a multi-tenant SaaS that talks
to ERPNext/Dolibarr instances running **on the customer's premises**)
needs the same primitive: an outbound WebSocket from a local agent to
a SaaS relay, routing MCP `tools/call` through the tunnel.

The question: where does this **network tunnel** primitive belong?

## Options considered

### A. New sibling package `@casys/mcp-tunnel`

Pros: strict SRP, decouples "tunnel" from "UI bridging" packaging.

Cons: **duplicates ~1600 LOC of WebSocket + JSON-RPC + session/router
plumbing already living in `mcp-bridge/src/core/`** (battle-tested,
~120 tests). Two packages would each carry their own copy of the same
machinery.

### B. Inside `@casys/mcp-compose/src/deploy/`

Pros: design already there, types defined.

Cons: `mcp-compose` is a **dashboard composition** library. The tunnel
is a primitive used by `compose/deploy` for one specific use case
(publishing a composed dashboard with local-data MCPs), but the
primitive itself is more general. Locking it inside `compose/deploy/`
means every other consumer (erp-platform, future on-prem cases) would
have to import all of `mcp-compose` to reach it.

### C. Inside `@casys/mcp-server` core

Pros: it's a transport-level concern.

Cons: the tunnel has two sides (relay server + local agent), with
auth/session/routing surface. That's more than a transport — it's a
mini-product on top of the transport.

### D. Inside `@casys/mcp-bridge`, as a new `adapters/network/` sibling

Pros:

- **Semantic correctness**: `bridge` literally means "passing traffic
  between two environments that can't talk directly". Telegram bridge,
  LINE bridge, on-prem bridge are three instances of the same concept.
  The current package name is a *generic* bridging concept; the
  Telegram/LINE specialization is just what shipped first.
- **Code reuse**: `bridge/src/core/` already implements the exact
  primitives a network tunnel needs (WebSocket transport, JSON-RPC
  protocol builders, MessageRouter, session abstraction with auth
  handler, BridgeClient). Targeted reuse, no duplication.
- **Modular extension**: `adapters/network/` sits next to
  `adapters/telegram/`, `adapters/line/`. Same shape, same pattern.
  Adding more bridging adapters (Slack, Discord, IRC, custom RPC) does
  not destabilize the package.

Cons:

- The `mcp-bridge` external positioning has to evolve from "UI bridging"
  to "MCP bridging (UI **and** network)". This is a documentation /
  README change, not an architectural one.
- Some users that import `mcp-bridge` expecting only Telegram/LINE
  surface might be surprised by the network-tunnel exports — but
  exports are tree-shakeable, so there is no runtime cost.

## Decision

**D — `@casys/mcp-bridge`, with a new `src/adapters/network/`
sub-module.**

The `core/` primitives (WebSocketTransport, MessageRouter, protocol
builders, BridgeSession, auth handler) are reused as-is. The network
adapter sits next to `adapters/telegram/` and `adapters/line/` and ships
its own client (run by the customer-side agent) and server (run by the
SaaS relay).

The package description / README will evolve to describe `mcp-bridge`
as a generic bridging layer, with sub-modules per host platform — the
host being either a messaging app (Telegram/LINE) or a network endpoint
(SaaS relay).

## Consequences

### `mcp-compose/src/deploy/` becomes a consumer, not an owner

The tunnel types (`TunnelConnection`, `DeployTransport`) currently in
`mcp-compose/src/deploy/types.ts` are **structurally relocated** to
`mcp-bridge/src/adapters/network/types.ts`. `mcp-compose/deploy/`
imports them from there, and the deploy module narrows its
responsibility to:

- the Deno Deploy publishing logic (creating relay project, deploying
  cloud-side MCPs)
- the dashboard-specific HTML wiring

The "tunnel" is no longer something `mcp-compose` *owns*. It's
something it *uses*.

### Action items (deferred, separate sessions)

- Implement `mcp-bridge/src/adapters/network/{client,server,auth,types}.ts`
  with first-class support for: outbound WS from local agent, multi-tenant
  routing on relay side, agent registration handshake, secret rotation,
  reconnect, backpressure, replay/idempotence on `tools/call`.
- Migrate types from `mcp-compose/src/deploy/types.ts` (the bits that
  describe the tunnel, **not** the deploy-specific request/result).
- Update `mcp-compose/src/deploy/readme.md` and `contract.md` to point
  at `@casys/mcp-bridge`'s network adapter instead of describing the
  tunnel inline.
- Update `mcp-bridge/README.md` to describe the new generalized scope.

### What this ADR does NOT decide

- The on-the-wire protocol of the network tunnel (MCP-over-WebSocket
  framing, agent registration handshake schema, replay token format).
  These are the subject of a follow-up ADR or design doc when impl
  starts.
- Whether the `mcp-compose/deploy/` design (Deno Deploy-based ephemeral
  relay) is still the right shape for `erp-platform`'s permanent
  multi-tenant routing needs. Likely it is not — `erp-platform` will
  ship its own integration of the bridge's network server inside its
  Fresh app rather than spawning per-call workers.

## Trail of reasoning

Three independent sources converged on the same conclusion:

1. **Erwan (project owner)**: pointed out that semantically a *bridge*
   and a *tunnel* recover the same concept ("passing traffic between
   environments that can't talk directly"), and that "displaying in
   Telegram, displaying in Claude.ai, displaying in LINE — same fight".
2. **Claude (assistant)**: confirmed by reading the actual code that
   `bridge/core/` is generic JSON-RPC + WebSocket plumbing, not
   Telegram-specific. The Telegram/LINE adapters are thin specializations
   on top of generic primitives.
3. **Codex (independent review)**: initially recommended a new
   `@casys/mcp-tunnel` package on SRP grounds, before the semantic +
   code-reuse arguments were laid out. The revision is consistent with
   Codex's own caveat that "compose/deploy can become the first
   consumer/reference" — i.e. the primitive belongs upstream of
   compose, which now applies to bridge as well.
