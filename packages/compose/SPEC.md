# mcp-compose — MCP Apps UI Orchestrator

## Vision

Lightweight Deno library for composing and synchronizing multiple MCP Apps UIs into composite
dashboards. The missing layer between isolated MCP server UIs.

**Core value proposition:** "Your MCP servers already have UIs. mcp-compose makes them talk to each
other."

## What This Is

A standalone, dependency-free library that:

1. **Collects** UI resources from MCP tool responses (`_meta.ui.resourceUri`)
2. **Composes** them into layouts (split, tabs, grid, stack)
3. **Synchronizes** cross-UI events via declarative sync rules
4. **Generates** self-contained HTML dashboards with an event bus

## What This Is NOT

- Not a gateway or proxy
- Not a tracing/observability system
- Not an auth layer
- Not an MCP client (bring your own)
- Not PML (no procedural memory, no learning, no capability loading)

## Product Boundary

This spec describes the composition primitive.
It does not define a no-code or end-user dashboard builder.
Orchestration authoring is assumed to happen upstream in developer, agent, or product-layer code.

## Modules

### 1. `core/` — Composition semantics

`core` is the source of truth for the composition model.
It owns:

- `types/` — `UiLayout`, `UiSyncRule`, `UiOrchestration`, resource and descriptor types
- `collector/` — extraction and accumulation of `_meta.ui.resourceUri`
- `sync/` — sync rule validation and resolution
- `composer/` — `buildCompositeUi(...)`
- `renderer/` — HTML and event-bus generation

This layer stays deterministic, side-effect free, and dependency-free.

### 2. `sdk/` — External shape adapters

`sdk` owns adaptation only:

- `createMcpSdkCollector()` for SDK-shaped `CallToolResult` values
- `uiMeta()` for typed `_meta.ui` construction
- `validateComposition()` for tool-definition-level semantic checks

`sdk` does not own composition semantics or rendering logic.

### 3. `host/` — Host integration contracts

`host` defines the host-facing contracts for embedding composite UIs.
It stays intentionally thin and type-oriented.

## AX (Agent Experience) Design Principles

This library is designed to be used BY agents, not just humans:

1. **Fast fail early**: Invalid sync rules, bad resource URIs → immediate clear errors, not runtime
   surprises.
2. **Deterministic outputs**: Same inputs → same outputs. No hidden heuristics.
3. **Machine-readable errors**: Structured error objects with codes, not just string messages.
4. **Explicit over implicit**: No magic defaults that change behavior. Everything is declared.
5. **Composable primitives**: Each function does one thing. Collector → Composer → Renderer. Agents
   can use each step independently.
6. **Documentation co-located**: Each module has its own README with I/O contract.
7. **Test-first invariants**: Every sync rule behavior has a test.
8. **Narrow contracts**: Minimal required inputs, maximal type safety.

## Dependencies

**Zero runtime dependencies.** Deno standard library only where needed. No npm packages, no external
frameworks.

## MCP Apps Protocol Compliance

The event bus implements:

- `ui/initialize` — handshake with host capabilities
- `ui/compose/event` — dedicated cross-UI event routing (mcp-compose protocol)
- `ui/update-model-context` — context sharing between UIs (legacy)
- `ui/notifications/tool-result` — forwarding results to target UIs
- `ui/message` — logging/debugging channel

All messages follow JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Current Status

Implemented today:

- canonical `core / sdk / host / runtime` structure
- collector, sync, composer, and renderer pipeline
- `composeEvents()` SDK with dedicated `ui/compose/event` protocol
- `uiMeta()` builder for declaring emits/accepts
- runtime: manifest parsing, template YAML, cluster management, HTTP transport
- MCP SDK adaptation helpers
- host contracts + renderer
- test suite with cross-slice pipeline coverage (200+ tests)
- JSR sync/publish automation

Future work remains possible, but it should stay within the primitive/product boundary above.

## Roadmap

### Next — Enable first real dashboard

- [ ] Add `emits`/`accepts` to mcp-einvoice tools (via `uiMeta()`)
- [ ] Add `composeEvents()` to mcp-einvoice UIs (invoice-viewer, doclist-viewer)
- [ ] Generate manifest for mcp-einvoice (with `requiredEnv` + `transport`)
- [ ] Runtime integration tests with a mock MCP server (HTTP transport)
- [ ] End-to-end test: manifest + template + cluster → rendered dashboard

### Short-term — CLI and user experience

- [ ] CLI `mcp-compose compose` — design dashboards from manifests (no servers needed,
      agent browses available tools/emits/accepts, generates template YAML)
- [ ] CLI `mcp-compose deploy <template.yaml>` — fetch MCPs from JSR, prompt for
      missing env vars (from `requiredEnv`), start servers, serve dashboard
- [ ] Local credential storage (`.env` or keychain, per template)
- [ ] Sync rule auto-discovery from manifests (propose wiring from emits/accepts)
- [ ] Dashboard persistence (save/load templates as YAML)

### Medium-term — Composition and sync

- [ ] Conditional sync (event data matching, e.g., filter by field value)
- [ ] Bidirectional sync rules
- [ ] Sync rule composition (chains: A → B → C)

### Long-term — SDK as intelligent router (Tailscale for MCPs)

The SDK becomes a local daemon that bridges local data sources to online dashboards.
Like Tailscale creates a mesh between machines, the SDK creates a mesh between MCPs
and dashboards — regardless of where data lives.

Architecture:
```
mcp-compose connect
  → SDK starts local MCPs (Docker ERPNext, postgres, etc.)
  → SDK opens outbound WebSocket to cloud relay (no port forwarding needed)
  → Dashboard served at https://dashboard-xxx.casys.dev
  → Tool calls from dashboard → relay → WebSocket → SDK local → MCP → DB
  → Data never leaves the local network (only query results travel)
```

Milestones:
- [ ] `mcp-compose connect` — local daemon that starts MCPs + opens tunnel
- [ ] Cloud relay worker (Deno Deploy) — routes HTTP ↔ WebSocket per session
- [ ] Cloud-native MCPs (SaaS APIs like Iopole) run as Subhosting workers
      (no tunnel needed, MCP runs in the cloud with user credentials)
- [ ] Local-data MCPs (ERPNext Docker, postgres) connect via tunnel
- [ ] Shareable dashboard URLs — one link, data stays local
- [ ] Multi-tenant session management
- [ ] Dashboard hot-reload (template changes without restart)

## Source Reference

Extracted and improved from `packages/pml/src/ui/composite-generator.ts` and
`packages/pml/src/types/ui-orchestration.ts`. The PML versions remain unchanged — this is a clean
extraction with improvements.
