# runtime

Dashboard composition from manifests, templates, and live MCP servers. This is the only
`mcp-compose` layer with I/O: it starts or connects servers, calls tools, reads MCP resources, and
can serve a local interactive MCP Apps host. The composition semantics remain in `core/`.

## API

- `composeDashboard(request)` — validate → start/connect → call → collect → compose → render. It is
  compatible with the historical static renderer.
- `composeDashboardFromFiles(manifestDir, templatePath, args)` — file-loading convenience wrapper
  for the static composition path.
- `composeAndServeDashboard(request, options?)` — preferred interactive path: composes, keeps the
  cluster alive, and returns a loopback host handle.
- `serveComposedDashboard(result, options?)` — serve a result previously made with
  `composeDashboard({ keepAlive: true })`.
- `createCluster`, `startServer`, and `connectHttp` — connection lifecycle.
- `parseManifest` / `loadManifests`, `parseTemplate` / `loadTemplate`, `injectArgs`, and
  `validateTemplate` — file and contract helpers.

Use `composeAndServeDashboard()` when an App must receive its initial tool result or call back to
its MCP server. `renderComposite()` and the HTML on a plain `ComposeResult` remain useful for a
static layout, but do not create an MCP resource bridge.

```ts
import { composeAndServeDashboard, loadManifests, loadTemplate } from "@casys/mcp-compose/runtime";

const manifests = await loadManifests("./manifests");
const template = await loadTemplate("./dashboards/operations.yaml");
const dashboard = await composeAndServeDashboard(
  { manifests, template },
  {
    open: true,
    // Optional: allow one reviewed local shell to embed this dashboard.
    frameAncestors: ["http://127.0.0.1:60060"],
  },
);

console.log(dashboard.url);
// Call dashboard.shutdown() when the local dashboard is no longer needed.
```

## Transport compatibility

`http` and started `stdio` manifests use an MCP HTTP endpoint. The default `transport.protocol` is
`"auto"`: Compose first probes the stateless `2026-07-28` protocol, then falls back only for an
unsupported-version or method-not-found response to the official initialized Streamable HTTP client.

Set a protocol explicitly when it is known:

```json
{
  "transport": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3020",
    "protocol": "streamable-http"
  }
}
```

The stateless adapter carries the required version, client metadata, and request-mirroring headers
for every request. The legacy path remains an MCP client session, not a guessed HTTP shortcut.

## Interactive host contract

The local host never assumes that an MCP server exposes `/ui`. For each collected `ui://` URI it
calls `resources/read`, serves the returned HTML on a dedicated loopback child origin, and gives the
parent dashboard a separate loopback origin. The parent event bus verifies both the iframe window
and its origin before forwarding requests.

The child may use only these capability-gated MCP methods:

- `tools/call` and `tools/list` for tools explicitly marked `appCallable` in that source manifest;
- `resources/read` and `resources/list` for the exact `ui://` resource that created the slot.

`appCallable` is deny-by-default. It is a browser-capability grant, not a claim that a tool is safe
for every client:

```json
{
  "name": "console_refresh",
  "description": "Refresh read-only observations.",
  "appCallable": true
}
```

The complete initiating `CallToolResult` is delivered exactly once after the App sends
`ui/notifications/initialized`; this preserves `content`, `structuredContent`, `isError`, and
`_meta`.

The serving API binds only to `127.0.0.1`; it intentionally has no hostname override. Remote
exposure, authentication, and tunnels belong to a separate deployment adapter.
The dashboard document denies framing by default. `frameAncestors` accepts validated HTTP(S)
origins only and exists for explicit local product shells, not broad wildcard embedding.

## Design decisions

- **Static manifests** describe the reviewed source/tool surface without relying on unrestricted
  browser discovery.
- **Templates are YAML** because agents can generate and humans can review layouts and
  `{{placeholder}}` arguments.
- **Parallel source startup, sequential calls per source** preserve possible intra-source
  dependencies while avoiding unrelated startup latency.
- **No implicit retry** keeps retry policy with the caller.

## AX design

- Every transport failure has a machine-readable `RuntimeErrorCode`.
- A non-interactive composition always stops its cluster in `finally`; an interactive handle stops
  it in `shutdown()`.
- Tool calls without a UI and failed optional calls become explicit warnings.
- The static renderer remains deterministic; interactive hosting is explicit.
