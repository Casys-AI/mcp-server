 *    there is no boundary to enforce and the sentinel above is honest about it.
 *    The method and argument bindings still apply.
 * 2. **Authenticated with a subject** — the binding separates callers, which is
 *    the case it exists for.
 * 3. **Authenticated without a usable subject** — `AuthInfo.subject` falls back to
 *    `"unknown"` for a valid token carrying no `sub` claim. Sealing against that
 *    would put every such caller under one identity: a token minted for one could
 *    be spent by another, while the code reads as though the binding were
 *    enforced. That is worse than no auth, because it is invisible. Throws.
