/**
 * Type definitions for Multi Round-Trip Requests (MRTR, spec 2026-07-28, SEP-2322).

 * MRTR entirely replaces the old server-initiated request pattern. Instead of
 * the server pushing sampling/createMessage, elicitation/create or roots/list
 * over a side channel, the server returns an InputRequiredResult from any
 * tools/call, resources/read or prompts/get request. The client gathers the
 * data and retries the ORIGINAL method under a NEW JSON-RPC id, carrying
 * inputResponses (keyed by the server-assigned ids from the previous result)
 * and echoing requestState verbatim if one was included.
