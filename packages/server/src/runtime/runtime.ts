/**
 * Runtime adapter — selector
 *
 * Auto-detects the host runtime and forwards to the Deno or Node adapter.
 * This is the module every consumer imports. It replaces the previous
 * build-time file swap (runtime.ts <- runtime.node.ts), which only ever
 * applied to mcp-server's own npm build and never to JSR consumers that
 * bundle the Deno source for Node (e.g. @casys/mcp-erpnext via esbuild),
 * whose bundle therefore embedded `Deno.*` calls and crashed under Node
 * with "ReferenceError: Deno is not defined".
 *
 * A *dynamic* import is used on purpose so only the active runtime's adapter
 * enters the module graph: under Deno, runtime.node.ts — and its top-level
 * `node:http` / `node:fs/promises` / `node:buffer` imports — is never loaded.
 * That matters because Deno Deploy (the canonical cloud target) does not
 * support node:http's raw-TCP `createServer`; eagerly importing it could
 * crash the deployment at module-graph resolution time. Under Node, the Deno
 * adapter is likewise never loaded.
 *
 * @see types.ts for the RuntimePort contract
 * @see runtime.deno.ts / runtime.node.ts for the implementations
 * @module lib/server/runtime
