# ADR 0003: View SDK Non-Goals for v0.5.0

Date: 2026-04-18  Status: Accepted

## Context

`@casys/mcp-compose/view` v0.5.0 ships three primitives: `navigate`,
`callTool`, `capabilities`. The MVP was intentionally minimal to solve one
concrete pain point: MCP App authors using `sendMessage` (`ui/message`) for
every in-App navigation, which pollutes the chat thread and triggers the
Claude prompt-injection warning on every click.

Several natural features were **deferred**. This ADR records what and why,
so the v0.6+ roadmap does not drift into scope creep and so authors reading
the SDK know what's intentionally missing (vs just not yet built).

## Deferred features

### 1. `ctx.sendMessage(text, { disclosure })` wrapper

Accessible via `ctx.app.sendMessage(...)` (escape hatch).

**Deferred rationale:** `sendMessage` has legitimate uses (asking the model
to reason about a structured action) but encourages the anti-pattern this
SDK exists to replace. Shipping it in the MVP would make migration from
`sendMessage` to `callTool` + `navigate` feel optional instead of the
intended default. The v0.6 wrapper will require an explicit `disclosure`
prop whose string gets rendered in the UI before the message is sent — no
silent chat injection possible through the SDK.

### 2. `ctx.requestDisplayMode(mode)`

Accessible via `ctx.app.requestDisplayMode(...)`.

**Deferred rationale:** einvoice and erpnext already get fullscreen working
natively on Claude; the feature is not blocking real use cases. When
compose's own dashboard host implements the counterpart handler (see
`roadmap-after-v0.14.0.md` item 1b), the View-side wrapper will land in the
same release.

### 3. `ctx.updateModelContext(payload)`

Accessible via `ctx.app.updateModelContext(...)`.

**Deferred rationale:** semantically overlaps with `callTool` for most use
cases. Needs a clear mental model for authors ("when do I use which?") before
promoting to first-class SDK API.

### 4. URL-based routing / history API integration

Not planned.

**Rationale:** MCP App iframes have no meaningful address bar or history
context. Memory-only routing is the right abstraction.

### 5. React / Vue / Svelte bindings

Planned as separate sub-exports: `@casys/mcp-compose/view-react`,
`/view-vue`, `/view-svelte`.

**Deferred rationale:** the vanilla core is the contract; framework
adapters are thin wrappers that can ship independently without touching
the core API.

### 6. Type-level view map inference (`keyof V` on `navigate` / `currentView`)

Currently typed as `string`. Upgrading to `keyof V` would let typos in
view names fail at compile time.

**Deferred rationale:** requires adding a second generic parameter to
`AppHandle` / `AppContext` (`<S, V extends ViewMap<S>>`). Non-trivial
refactor and a breaking change for early adopters. Target: v0.6 or v1.0
with a single coordinated break.

### 7. Automatic `ontoolresult` → view refresh wiring

Authors opt in via `ctx.app.addEventListener("toolresult", ...)`.

**Rationale:** different views want different refresh semantics; a blanket
"refresh on any tool result" creates more bugs than it solves.

## Decision

v0.5.0 ships the three primitives above, and nothing else. Every deferred
feature has a known path to v0.6+ that is non-breaking (optional fields
on existing types).

## Consequences

- Authors migrating from `sendMessage` keep access to it via `ctx.app`;
  no behavior is *removed*, only *not promoted*.
- The public API surface stays small and teachable. Readme / examples can
  cover the full SDK in <20 lines of code.
- v0.6 planning has a clean list of candidates, each with existing
  rationale captured here.
