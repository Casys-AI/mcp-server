# view-basic

End-to-end integration demo for `@casys/mcp-view`.

Exercises the real handshake + router path with two views (list, detail) and
SPA navigation via `ctx.navigate(...)` — the pattern that replaces
`app.sendMessage("show details for X")` (which would pollute the chat thread
and trigger Claude's "the app is trying to speak for you" warning).

## Build

```bash
deno run --allow-all packages/view/examples/basic/build.ts
```

If your Deno cache was populated by a different user (hardlink EPERM during
esbuild), override `DENO_DIR`:

```bash
DENO_DIR=/tmp/deno-cache deno run --allow-all \
  packages/view/examples/basic/build.ts
```

Produces `dist/index.html`: a self-contained HTML file with CSS and the
bundled JS inlined. No external fetches, ready to be served as a
`ui://` MCP resource.

Current output size: ~490 KB (JS 418 KB minified — dominated by
transitive `zod` + full MCP SDK). Above the initial 200 KB aspiration;
see Blockers below.

## Open

Open `dist/index.html` directly in a browser. You will see:

- A banner "Local-only mode: no MCP host detected" (expected — the demo
  detects the absence of a parent frame and falls back to a local-only
  driver that runs the same view definitions without the ext-apps
  transport layer).
- A list of 3 mock invoices. Click any row (or focus + Enter) →
  detail view mounts, **same page, same tab, no chat message**.
- Back button → list view remounts with state preserved.

When hosted inside an MCP Apps-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, etc.),
the same bundle takes the `createMcpApp` path: real `ui/initialize`
handshake, real `ctx.callTool` available to views.

## Files

- `src/main.ts` — entry, boots `createMcpApp` or local fallback.
- `src/list-view.ts` — `defineView` for list (3 mock invoices).
- `src/detail-view.ts` — `defineView` for detail (Back button).
- `src/state.ts` — shared `AppState` type.
- `src/styles.css` — inlined into the final HTML.
- `build.ts` — esbuild + deno loader, ESM bundle, inline to `dist/index.html`.

## Blockers / Notes

- **Bundle size**: `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` pulls in the full
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `zod@4`. Tree-shaking can't drop much
  because App/PostMessageTransport reference SDK schemas. Future: push
  ext-apps upstream for a browser-only sub-entry without server SDK, or
  rewrite the transport without SDK schema validation.
- **No Node builtins** were pulled in at runtime — the SDK path to
  `PostMessageTransport` stays DOM-only, as the spec requires.
- **No `import.meta.url` blockers** encountered: the SDK honours its own
  bundling rule (see `src/spec.md` §"Bundling rules").
